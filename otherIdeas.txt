Potential projects:

1. chat room
    straightfoward, simple, attainable MVP
        stretch goals:
        - add image support
        - add name support
        - add some kind of chat history



2. some kind of user created battle sim
    users create a "character"
    periodically a battle takes place (hourly or something), winner is crowned, leaderboard maintained perpetually
    this would run a server that needs to be perpetually running, bad idea?

3. some kind of chaotic group-play version of a classic game
    tic-tac-toe / xs os
    chess
    checkers
    scrabble
